My 2025 Portfolio
============

For years, I've implemented DevOps philosophy to empower developers and shift 
them to the right, from their code to the production infrastructure. 

And now, they have taken over my job ! SRE is no longer about crafting infra
for others to use, it's about providing **automation and abstractions** to the 
next level so my fellows coworkers can craft their own infrastructure. 

Developers shifted so much to the right (toward the prod) that I am now shifting
to the left (toward the code) and together we will truly implement the DevOps
philosophy where there are no silos and everyone understand what the others are 
doing. 


# What I am working on now

A [Kubernetes Job Assistant](k8s_job_assistant) to offer an **easy to use UI** for **non-tech people**
to run/kill/tail Kubernetes jobs. 

There are many ways to do this already, this project is to learn and showcase
what I can do with Golang.
