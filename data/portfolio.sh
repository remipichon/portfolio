            I am so glad to see you there.

            If you haven't taken a look, here is my LinkedIn with some textual non interactive interface:
                https://www.linkedin.com/in/remipichon/

            What's really worth the look is my Github:
                https://github.com/remipichon
            with some pretty cool project like the Portfolio https://github.com/remipichon/portfolio
            and many others than I am going to present you there anyway.

            Are you ready to astonished by the latest cutting edge UI, so neat you will want to refactor all your dashboards to this ?
